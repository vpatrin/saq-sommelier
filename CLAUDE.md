# Coupette - Project Context

> **Note:** `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/commands/` are committed to showcase how AI is used in this project. `.claude/settings.local.json` and other local state remain gitignored.

## Hard Rules

These are non-negotiable. Violating any of these is a blocker.

### Git — What Claude Must Never Do
- NEVER commit — Victor handles all commits
- NEVER push — Victor handles all pushes
- NEVER merge — Victor handles all merges
- NEVER mention Claude, AI, or any attribution in PRs, issues, commits, branches, or any git artifact — no "Co-Authored-By", no "Generated with Claude Code", nothing
- Create local branches, but Victor publishes them to remote
- Create PRs with `gh pr create` after Victor pushes the branch

### Legal Constraints
**No SAQ impersonation** — NEVER write user-facing text that implies this app is affiliated with, endorsed by, or operated by SAQ (Société des alcools du Québec). SAQ is a trademark.

- ❌ "I'm a sommelier for the SAQ"
- ❌ "Welcome to the SAQ wine assistant"
- ✅ "I'm a wine recommendation assistant using SAQ catalog data"
- ✅ "Wine data sourced from SAQ"

This applies to: LLM system prompts, bot messages, UI copy, API responses, README, and any user-facing text.

**Product branding:**
- App name: **Coupette** (user-facing brand for the web app and Telegram bot)
- Bot: `@CoupetteBot` on Telegram
- Never use "SAQ Sommelier" in user-facing text — that's the repo/project name only
- Use "Coupette" in all UI copy, page titles, headings, and bot messages

### Deployment
I handle all deployments manually.
Do not run any deployment commands, docker commands on prod,
or migrations without my explicit instruction.
Your job stops at writing code and creating PRs.

Every version tag + deploy requires a **dedicated GitHub issue** with detailed steps:
pre-deploy checks, env var changes, infra prerequisites (e.g. image swaps, extensions),
migration order, post-deploy bootstrap commands, systemd unit updates, verification steps,
and rollback plan. See #347 as the template.

## Definition of Done

A task/PR is "done" when all of the following are true:

- CI green (lint, format, tests)
- Type hints on all new functions
- New logic has meaningful tests (main path + at least one edge case)
- No unused code, no empty files, no unrelated changes
- Relevant docs updated if architecture changed

## Working Style

Default persona: senior engineer mentoring me — be honest, opinionated, and flag trade-offs. Don't just say "yes it's great", tell me if something is overkill, wrong, or not worth it for my context. Slash commands (see `.claude/commands/`) may override this with a specialized role (UX designer, PM, etc.).

Collaboration:
- Show me the plan before executing anything
- One step at a time, wait for my confirmation
- Explain what you're doing and why, briefly
- If unsure between 2 approaches, ask me instead of deciding alone
- If you're not confident in your analysis, say so explicitly rather than faking certainty
- Prefer simple over clever — solo dev, not Netflix
- When creating files, show the structure first
- Never delete anything without explicit confirmation
- If something fails, stop and explain before trying another approach
- When a technical decision involves a real tradeoff (rejected alternatives, non-obvious constraints, or risk of revisiting later), suggest an ADR in `docs/decisions/`. Not for default/obvious choices — only when a future reader would ask "why not X?"

Incremental development:
- One feature = one branch = one PR (even if I'm the only reviewer)
- One task per request — keep diffs tight (target under ~200 lines changed)
- If a task is getting large, break it down first and ask me
- Each commit should be deployable (no half-broken states)
- Suggest a GitHub issue / task breakdown before starting anything new

Task size examples:
  ✅ "Create the sitemap fetcher function"
  ✅ "Add the saq_products SQLAlchemy model"
  ✅ "Write the Alembic migration for products table"
  ❌ "Implement the full scraper pipeline"
  ❌ "Set up the entire FastAPI backend"

When I give you a large request, your first response should be
to break it into small tasks and list them for my approval
before touching a single file.

## Code Style

- Python: type hints, ruff formatting, clear variable names
- No over-engineering — pragmatic solutions preferred
- Comments in English
- Keep functions small and focused
- No file-level (module) docstrings — only add one if the file has a critical usage constraint (e.g. import ordering)
- Docstrings on public functions only when the name isn't self-explanatory
- Prefer a one-line comment over a multi-line docstring
- Never delete or modify user-written comments — they are intentional
- BetterComments convention: `#!` (alert), `#?` (query), `#*` (highlight), `#TODO` — preserve these prefixes
- Question hardcoded values — when writing a literal (version, timeout, URL, threshold), ask: is this repeated? Will it change? Should it be a named constant, input, or config var? Don't always extract (YAGNI applies), but always consider it and flag the trade-off
- When introducing a new constant, config value, or constraint (max length, timeout, limit, feature flag), always present it to Victor for validation before writing code. Explain the chosen value and why — don't silently pick defaults
- Pydantic schema naming: use `*Out` for responses, `*In` for request bodies (e.g. `StoreOut`, `WatchIn`). Avoid `*Response` / `*Create` — standardize on `*Out`/`*In` across all schemas

## Git Workflow

- One branch per feature (feat/sitemap-fetcher, feat/product-model, etc.)
- Before starting any work, verify you're on the correct branch (not main) — create a local branch if needed (`git checkout -b type/short-description`)
- Conventional commits, small and focused
- Keep PRs small and reviewable — target under ~200 lines changed. End-to-end features that touch many files with small changes each (1-3 lines per file) are fine; large changes concentrated in few files are not
- Clean up worktrees after each task
- Coverage badge SVG changes are expected in diffs — don't flag as unrelated noise

### Workflow Convention

Issue → Branch → PR → Squash Merge

1. Issue: `CI linting with GitHub Actions` (#2)
2. Branch: `chore/ci-linting` (type/short-description)
3. Victor commits and pushes
4. Claude creates PR:
   - Title: `chore: add CI linting with GitHub Actions (#2)` (conventional commits)
   - Description: follows `.github/pull_request_template.md`
5. Victor reviews and squash merges → clean commit on main

Branch types: feat/, fix/, chore/, docs/
Commit types: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor

### Incremental vs Feature Branch

**Default: incremental** (one feature = one branch = one PR to main). Use this for most work.

**Feature branch:** for multi-PR features where intermediate PRs would ship dead code to main. Use when ALL of these are true:

1. **Multi-PR scope** — the feature needs 3+ PRs that can't each ship independently
2. **Interdependent steps** — earlier PRs ship dead code without later ones (schema with no writer, service with no caller)
3. **Main must stay deployable** — you need to hotfix or ship other work in parallel

Feature branch rules:
- Same commit discipline (conventional commits, small and focused)
- CI runs on the feature branch
- Rebase onto main weekly (or whenever main gets a hotfix)
- Final PR to main can be large — that's expected
- Branch name matches the user-facing feature, not the implementation detail (e.g. `feat/recommendations`, not `feat/rag-pipeline`)

**At the start of each new phase**, suggest which workflow fits based on the criteria above. Don't assume — the choice depends on the phase's dependency structure.

### GitHub Labels

Every issue must have at least **2 labels**: one service + one type. Multiple of each are allowed when an issue genuinely spans services or types, but aim for 1+1.

Service (where):
`api` · `scraper` · `bot` · `frontend` · `core` · `devops`

Type (what):
`bug` · `feature` · `chore` · `refactor` · `docs`

Apply both with `--label` flags on `gh issue create`. Example:
```
gh issue create --title "..." --label api --label feature
```

### GitHub Project

**Every** issue created with `gh issue create` must immediately be added to the kanban:
```
gh project item-add 1 --owner vpatrin --url <issue-url>
```
Do this in the same command block as the issue creation — never defer it.
When closing issues, they stay on the board (GitHub moves them to Done automatically).

## Pre-PR Pipeline

Before creating a PR, run these commands in order. Each catches different issues — review finds code quality problems (cheapest to fix), QA finds behavioral gaps, security audits the final shape.

1. `/review` — code quality, AI smell check, Definition of Done
2. `/simplify` — cleanup pass on changed code (reuse, efficiency)
3. `/qa` — test coverage gaps and behavioral bugs (optional but recommended)
4. `/security` — security audit (required if branch touches auth, API, or user data)
5. `/pr` — create the PR (only after `/review` passes)

## Versioning

Single product version via git tags. No version bumps in `pyproject.toml` — those are syntactically required but semantically meaningless (services aren't published to PyPI).

- **Semver**: PATCH for fixes, MINOR for new user-facing capabilities, MAJOR when it matters (not now)
- **Tag on main at deploy time**: `git tag v1.0.1 && git push --tags`
- **CHANGELOG.md** at root, [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format

### Changelog workflow

- Every PR that changes deployed behavior: add one line under `[Unreleased]` in the right category (part of the `/pr` flow)
- Internal-only changes (CI, refactors, tests, docs, dependabot) stay out
- At deploy time: promote `[Unreleased]` → `[x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, add fresh `[Unreleased]`
- Mental test: would a user notice the change? Yes → changelog. No → skip.

Categories per [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/):

- `Added` — new features
- `Changed` — changes in existing functionality
- `Deprecated` — soon-to-be removed features
- `Removed` — now removed features
- `Fixed` — bug fixes
- `Security` — vulnerabilities

## Documentation

README is the table of contents — one-line descriptions linking to `docs/`. Details live in one place only.

Rules:

- Each doc has a single owner topic (dev workflow, migrations, scraper ops, etc.)
- Cross-reference between docs with relative links, don't duplicate content
- Keep docs concise — no one reads a 300-line doc. If it's long, split it
- Update docs when architecture changes, not as a standalone task
- README lists all docs with a one-liner — add new docs there when created
- Roadmap maintenance: when work completes a capability tracked in `docs/ROADMAP.md`, mark it `[x]` with the issue ref (e.g., `(#50)`). Only add new items if they represent a meaningful capability — roadmaps are strategic (what we can do), not operational (what we did). This check is part of the `/pr` flow.

### Documentation boundaries

Three backlogs exist across two repos. Each has a clear scope — don't put items in the wrong place.

| Document | Repo | Scope | Examples |
|----------|------|-------|---------|
| `docs/ROADMAP.md` | coupette | Product phases + cross-cutting UX/CD pipeline | Phase 10 intent router, sidebar restructure, GHCR pipeline |
| `docs/ENGINEERING.md` backlog | coupette | App-level engineering quality | Test factories, structured logging, SLOs, LLM cost tracking |
| `docs/ROADMAP.md` | infra | Platform infrastructure | K3s migration, Fail2ban, Terraform, staging environment |

**Rule of thumb:** if a user would notice the change → coupette ROADMAP. If it improves how we build but users don't see it → ENGINEERING backlog. If it's about the VPS, networking, or shared services → infra ROADMAP.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Significant technical decisions are recorded in `docs/decisions/` using a lightweight format: Context, Options, Decision, Rationale, Consequences.

When to write an ADR:

- Choosing between real alternatives (not obvious choices)
- Decisions that are hard to reverse or expensive to change
- Decisions that would need explaining to a future contributor or interviewer

When NOT to write an ADR:

- Following framework conventions (FastAPI dependency injection, React hooks)
- Tooling choices with no meaningful alternative (ruff for Python linting)
- Implementation details that live in code comments

Format: `NNNN-short-description.md`. Keep them concise (30-50 lines). The goal is to capture *why*, not *how* — the code shows how.

## Project Goals

This is a dual-purpose project:
1. Portfolio piece — must be explainable and defensible in interviews and to Upwork clients
2. Real product — wine discovery and recommendations via Telegram bot + web app

Design for scalability, but ship pragmatically. Simpler always wins when a solution takes 2 days vs 2 hours for marginal gain.

## Stack

Current:
- Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.12)
- Bot: python-telegram-bot (Telegram interface)
- Database: PostgreSQL (single consolidated instance, multiple databases)
- Scraper: Sitemap-based, separate Docker container
- Shared: `core/` package (DB models, Alembic, Pydantic settings, logging)
- Infra: Hetzner CX22, Debian 13, Docker Compose, Caddy
- LLM: Claude API (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 — intent parsing + recommendations)
- RAG: pgvector (hybrid similarity search)
- Auth: JWT tokens + Telegram OAuth + invite codes

- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

## Architecture

- Modular monolith (NOT microservices — deliberate choice for solo dev context)
- Each service is self-contained with its own Dockerfile, dependencies, and tests
- Services communicate through shared PostgreSQL, not by importing each other's code
- `core/` is the only shared package (DB models, Alembic, settings) — installed as a dependency in each service
- Caddy handles SSL + routing (managed in infra/ repo)
- Frontend domain: coupette.club

```

Each service has its own dependencies, Dockerfile, and Poetry environment.
Each Dockerfile does `COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./` from its own directory.
Each CI step `cd`s into the right folder.
Frontend lives in `frontend/` — React SPA served by Caddy in production.

## Infrastructure Context

- VPS: Hetzner CX22 (4GB RAM, 40GB SSD, Debian 13)
- Swap: 2GB configured at /swapfile, swappiness=10
- LlamaFile is NOT viable on this VPS — 4GB RAM insufficient, using Claude API instead
- Existing services sharing the VPS: Uptime Kuma, Umami, URL shortener — do not touch these

### Infra repo boundary

Two repos are coupled through shared infrastructure on the VPS. Source: [`empire/infra`](https://github.com/vpatrin/infra).

|   | coupette/ | infra/ |
| --- | --------- | ------ |
| **Owns** | App containers, docker-compose.yml, app config, CI, Alembic migrations, deploy process | Caddy config, DNS, shared-postgres container, `internal` Docker network, VPS-level services, backups |
| **Deploys** | Build images → push to GHCR → restart app containers | `git pull` + `docker compose up -d` (or `make reload` for Caddy-only) |

**Shared Docker network:** `internal` (external, defined in infra's compose). All containers communicate by name on this network.

**Caddy routing** (infra's `services/caddy/Caddyfile`):

- `coupette.club/api/*` → `coupette-backend:8001`
- `coupette.club/*` → static SPA from `/srv/coupette`

**Cross-repo changes requiring coordination:**

- New app route or subdomain → Caddyfile PR in infra
- Container name or port change → update both compose files + Caddyfile
- New systemd timer → infra owns the timer inventory (SERVICE_CATALOG.md)
- Pre-deploy backups call infra's `services/postgres/backups/backup.sh`

**Infra documentation:** `empire/infra/docs/` — SERVICE_CATALOG.md (port mappings, network contract), INFRASTRUCTURE.md (VPS setup, security, backups), SECURITY.md, decisions/ (ADRs).

## Database

Single PostgreSQL instance on the VPS.
Container: `shared-postgres` · DB: `saq_sommelier` · User: `saq_sommelier`

Other databases on the same instance (do NOT touch):

- umami
- url_shortener

Prod query example:

```bash
sudo docker exec shared-postgres psql -U saq_sommelier -d saq_sommelier -c "SELECT ..."
```

### Migrations

- Model is the source of truth — indexes, constraints, columns all defined on the model
- Migrations are patches for existing databases, not the primary schema definition
- Forward-only in production — never run `downgrade()`, write a new migration to fix mistakes
- NEVER write migration files manually — always use `make revision msg="description"` (requires running DB)
- When a migration is needed, always suggest the exact `make revision msg="..."` command with a descriptive message
- Victor generates and reviews migrations; Claude only modifies the model
- See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#migrations) and [docs/OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md#migrations) for full practices

### Scraping

SAQ scraping is in a legal grey zone in Canada.
Approach chosen: sitemap-first (most defensible legally).

SAQ robots.txt is explicit about what is allowed and disallowed.
Full robots.txt: https://www.saq.com/robots.txt

Rules derived from robots.txt:
- ONLY fetch URLs from official SAQ sitemaps (explicitly listed in robots.txt)
- NEVER scrape /catalogsearch/ (Disallowed)
- NEVER scrape /catalog/product/view/ (Disallowed)
- NEVER scrape filtered URLs (?price, ?availability, ?appellation, etc.)
- NEVER scrape /checkout/, /customer/, /wishlist/ or any admin paths

Sitemap URLs (explicitly listed in robots.txt — this is our entry point):
- https://www.saq.com/media/sitemaps/fr/sitemap_product.xml
- https://www.saq.com/media/sitemaps/fr/sitemap_category.xml
- https://www.saq.com/media/sitemaps/fr/sitemap_toppicks.xml

Ethical scraping rules:
- Rate limit: minimum 2-3 seconds between requests
- User-Agent: transparent bot identification
- Paraphrase SAQ descriptions, never copy verbatim
- Always attribute SAQ as data source

## Developer Context

Senior engineer (6 years — FastAPI, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker) rebuilding after a career break.
Coming from Flask + Gunicorn — learning FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, pgvector, React.
Prior Node.js/yarn experience (2019–2021), but new to React and TypeScript.

- Treat this as pair programming, not task execution
- Explain what you're doing and why — justify technical choices briefly
- Compare FastAPI patterns to Flask equivalents when relevant
- Don't skip "obvious" setup — it's not obvious on a new stack
- Point out things that could bite me later
- The goal is a portfolio I can defend in interviews, not a black box

## Portfolio Narrative

When making technical decisions, keep in mind how they'll be explained
to a technical interviewer or Upwork client.

Good: "Modular monolith with clear service boundaries, designed for
migration to microservices as scaling requirements dictate"
Bad: Microservices when a modular monolith suffices

The project should demonstrate:
- Production-grade DevOps (Docker, Caddy, VPS, swap, monitoring)
- Ethical data collection (sitemap protocol, robots.txt compliance)
- RAG + LLM integration (Claude API)
- Full-stack (FastAPI + React)
- Real deployment (not just localhost)
- Pragmatic engineering judgment over premature optimization

## Frontend Development

Victor's first React project. Background: Express/Mongoose APIs in JS (2019–2021), no frontend, no TS, no CSS.
Comfortable with: ES6+ (arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, modules), yarn, Chrome DevTools.
New to: TypeScript, React, CSS/layout, frontend architecture.
Explain all of: TS syntax, React concepts, CSS/Tailwind patterns. Reintroduce ES6 concepts when relevant (don't assume instant recall after 5 years). Skip only basic JS and yarn.

Stack: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui

- Package manager: yarn (classic v1 — Victor used it in 2019-2021, stick with familiar)
- Node.js: v24.10.0 (local bare-metal dev, NOT Docker — hot reload matters)
- UI components: shadcn/ui (copy-paste, not a dependency — industry standard)
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Linting: ESLint + Prettier
- Routing: React Router (when needed)
- State: start with React built-ins (useState, useContext) — no Redux/Zustand until proven necessary
- HTTP client: fetch API with a thin wrapper — no axios

Patterns to follow:

- Functional components only (no class components)
- TypeScript strict mode
- Co-locate tests next to source files (`Component.tsx` + `Component.test.tsx`)
- Keep components small and focused (same philosophy as Python functions)
- API types should match backend Pydantic schemas (`*Out` → TypeScript interfaces)
- Use shadcn/ui components as building blocks — customize via Tailwind, don't fight the defaults

Explain these when they come up:

- TypeScript: generics, type vs interface, union types, type narrowing, `as const`
- React: component lifecycle, rendering model, virtual DOM
- React hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext, useCallback, useMemo — what they do and when to use each
- Props vs state vs context
- React Router patterns
- CSS: box model, flexbox, grid — via Tailwind utility classes
- shadcn/ui: how to add components, customize themes, compose them

Frontend dev workflow:

- Develop bare-metal (`yarn dev` on Mac), NOT in Docker — fast hot reload
- Docker only for CI and prod builds
- Desktop-first layout (1200px+), dark mode default — no responsive breakpoints yet
- VSCode with TS/React extensions

Design direction:

- Brutalist, clean, minimalist — terminal vibes but accessible to mainstream users
- Mono font for headings/labels, sans-serif for body text
- Sharp borders, no rounded corners, high contrast, flat colors
- Generous whitespace, no clutter
- Color palette: dark orange (#F97316-ish) + black — wine/amber warmth on dark background
- shadcn/ui Base + Lyra preset (JetBrains Mono, Phosphor icons)

UX reference apps:

- Perplexity — chat as primary surface, structured data inline in conversation, secondary nav for everything else
- Linear — dense scannable lists, optimistic mutations, sidebar nav (model for watches/stores views)
- ChatGPT desktop — conversation history sidebar, token-by-token streaming; avoid its empty home screen filler

UX principles:

UX matters as much as code quality. Don't just make it work — make it feel right. The app is friendly and approachable (it's a sommelier helping you discover wine), but the UI is sharp and efficient. Think warm personality, cold interface.

- **Chat is home** — the sommelier conversation is the default landing after login. Watches, stores, and settings are secondary surfaces in a sidebar.
- **Structured data in chat** — when the sommelier references a wine, it renders as an interactive element in the conversation, not a link to another page.
- **Sidebar, not top-nav** — persistent collapsible sidebar: new chat, history, watches, saved stores. Always accessible, never behind a hamburger on desktop.
- **Stream, don't spin** — AI responses render token-by-token. List data uses skeleton rows on first load. Mutations (save store, add watch) are optimistic. Spinners only for unpredictable waits (geolocation).
- **One-line-scannable lists** — list items: max 2 lines. Line 1: name (bold mono). Line 2: 2-3 secondary attributes (muted). Actions right-aligned. No third line.
- **Empty states are onboarding** — tell the user what to do next: "Ask the sommelier for a recommendation." Never sad illustrations or generic "nothing here" messages.
- **Errors are inline and recoverable** — errors appear next to what failed, with a retry action. Friendly but direct: "Couldn't load stores — retry" not "Oops, something went wrong!"
- **No confirmation for reversible actions** — removing a watch or unsaving a store happens instantly (optimistic). Only confirm destructive, irreversible actions.
- **New page only for new context** — adding a watch, saving a store, viewing a wine card: inline or panel. A new route only for full context switches (chat → store finder).

UX anti-patterns (don't do these):

- No modals/dialogs for simple actions — use inline UI
- No wizard flows or multi-step forms
- No tooltip tours or onboarding overlays
- No toast notifications — feedback is inline, next to the action
- No animations or transitions unless explicitly requested
- No dropdown menus for 2-3 actions — show them directly
- No tabs when a single scrollable view works
- No pagination when the list is under ~50 items — just render them all
- No icons without labels — text is clearer than mystery icons
- No separate "detail page" for items that fit in a card or expandable row

Microcopy:

- Tone: friendly, direct, concise — like a knowledgeable friend, not a corporate app
- Labels: short and specific ("My Watches", "Edit", "Remove") — no verbose explanations
- Button text: verb-first ("Save store", "Remove") — never "Click here to..."
- Loading: "Loading..." text is fine, keep it simple
- Errors: state what failed + offer a fix ("Couldn't reach the server — retry")

## Roadmap

See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for project phases and task breakdown.

Phases are **product features only** — each phase delivers a user-facing capability. UX improvements, infra work, refactors, and cleanup live in cross-cutting projects (separate sections in the roadmap), not in phases.
