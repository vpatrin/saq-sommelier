### Phase 4 — API for Bot ✅

Backend endpoints driven by Telegram bot needs. See [specs/TELEGRAM_BOT.md](specs/TELEGRAM_BOT.md) for full design.

- [x] Product detail endpoint (#34)
- [x] Product search + filtering (#35)
- [x] Database indexes (#26)
- [x] Structured exception handling (#41)
- [x] Exclude delisted + available filter (#98)
- [x] Catalog facets endpoint (#55)
- [x] Sort by recent + random product (#99, #100)
- [x] Watches CRUD (#101) — powers `/watch`, `/unwatch`, `/alerts`
- ~~Price history tracking (#57)~~ — descoped, SAQ prices are regulated

### Phase 5 — Telegram Bot ✅

- [x] Bot scaffold (`bot/` service, python-telegram-bot) (#115)
- [x] Bot API client — typed httpx wrapper for backend endpoints (#116)
- ~~Inline keyboard filters — shared formatters, keyboards, filter callbacks (#118, #161)~~ — removed, browse UX belongs in web frontend
- ~~`/new` — recently added/updated wines with filters (#118)~~ — removed, browse UX belongs in web frontend
- ~~`/random` — random wine with filters (#118)~~ — removed, browse UX belongs in web frontend
- [x] `/watch`, `/unwatch`, `/alerts` — passive watch list + on-demand status check (#119)
- [x] Post-scrape restock notifications — proactive alerts when watched products come back (#138)
- [x] Destock notifications — alert users when watched products go out of stock (#212)
- [x] Bot Dockerfile + Compose service (#121, #44)

### Phase 5a — Bot UX Polish ✅

- ~~Improve category selection UX (#162)~~ — removed with browse commands
- [x] "Back" button to return to previous results (#163) — resolved by persistent reply keyboard
- [x] Main menu with navigation buttons (#164)
- ~~Disable link preview for multi-result messages (#165)~~ — removed with browse commands
- ~~Paginated results with next/previous buttons (#167)~~ — removed with browse commands
- [x] Auto-recap watch list after /watch and /unwatch (#183)

### Phase 5b — Store Availability ✅

See [specs/DATA_PIPELINE.md](specs/DATA_PIPELINE.md) for API reference and data pipeline design.

- [x] Store directory scrape (#128) — one-shot `stores` table (401 rows)
- [x] Emit destock events when availability flips True → False (#144)
- ~~Extract `magento_id` from HTML (#148)~~ — eliminated, GraphQL batch lookup used instead
- [x] `UserStorePreference` model + migration (#231)
- [x] `/stores` API endpoints — nearby + user preference CRUD (#232)
- [x] `/mystores` bot command — GPS-based store picker (#233)
- [x] Per-product store availability checker — GraphQL resolve + AJAX fetch + diff alerts (#149)
- [x] Targeted store fetch — lat/lng proximity sorting replaces full pagination (#254)
- ~~Filter by store availability (#150)~~ — out of scope, SAQ.com does this natively

### Phase 5c — Watch UX ✅

- [x] Auto-detect pasted SAQ URLs — prompt "Watch this?" without `/watch` command (#273)
- [x] Inline unwatch buttons on `/alerts` list (#240)
- [x] Delist notifications — alert watchers when SAQ removes a product from the catalog (#243)
- [x] Deep links — `t.me/bot?start=watch_{sku}` for external watch triggers (#273)

### Phase 5d — Bilingual Support

- [ ] Per-user language preference (FR default, EN opt-in) (#134)
- [ ] Static translation tables for structured fields (#151)
- [ ] Bilingual bot responses, button labels, and help text (#152)
- [ ] Bilingual formatters (#153)

### ~~Phase 5e — Discovery Rework~~ — frozen

`/new` and `/random` are demo-quality discovery features. The bot's core value is **passive alerting** (watch/alerts/notifications), not browsing. Discovery belongs in a future web frontend. No further investment here.

- [x] Default `/random` to wine categories only (#285)
- ~~Remaining items~~ — descoped, discovery moves to web frontend

### Phase 6 — AI Layer (RAG + Claude)

See [specs/DATA_PIPELINE.md](specs/DATA_PIPELINE.md) for data pipeline design and [specs/RECOMMENDATIONS.md](specs/RECOMMENDATIONS.md) for RAG architecture.

**Data pipeline (prerequisite):**

- [x] Adobe Live Search client — GraphQL wrapper with pagination, partitioning, rate limiting (#287)
- [x] `--availability-check` — daily Adobe availability refresh + watch transition detection (replaces `--check-watches`) (#289)
- [x] `--enrich-wines` — one-time wine attribute backfill from Adobe (tasting profiles, taste tag, grape blend, vintage)
- [x] Schema migration — new columns, `ProductAvailability` drop, `availability` → `online_availability` rename (#288)

**RAG + recommendations:**

- [x] pgvector + embeddings (#154)
- [x] Claude API integration (#155)
- [x] `/recommend` — natural language recommendations via Telegram (#156)
- [ ] Availability-aware intent parsing — distinguish online vs in-store vs both; tie in-store to user's preferred stores
- [ ] Weekly digest — LLM-curated summary posted to group chat after scraper run (#120)

### Ideas (unscoped)

- [ ] `/occasion` — context-aware suggestions ("wine for a BBQ", "gift for belle-mère") via Claude
- [ ] `/budget` — smart budget optimizer ("best rouge under $40") with value reasoning
- [ ] `/surprise` — discovery roulette that pushes outside comfort zone based on watch history
- [ ] `/gifter` — opt-in watch list sharing between friends for gift ideas
- [ ] `/blind` — blind tasting game: bot describes a wine, friends guess, track scores
- [ ] `/split` — group buy coordinator: share a bottle deal, track RSVPs among friends
- [ ] `/terroir` — region deep-dive with educational context + current SAQ inventory
- [ ] `/versus` — head-to-head wine comparison with Claude commentary on when to pick each
- [ ] `/cellar` — personal purchase tracker with taste profile insights over time
- [ ] `/digest` — weekly curated new arrivals summary, personalized to group preferences (#120)
- [ ] Rating aggregator — enrich products with Vivino scores and critic ratings; fuzzy name matching
- [ ] Price comparison vs France — compare SAQ prices to French retail (Wine-Searcher, Vinatis)
- [ ] Chrome extension — floating "Watch" button on SAQ product pages, triggers deep link to bot
