### Phase 4 — API for Bot ✅

- [x] Watches CRUD (#101) — powers `/watch`, `/unwatch`, `/alerts`
- ~~Price history tracking (#57)~~ — descoped, SAQ prices are regulated

### Phase 5 — Telegram Bot ✅

- [x] Bot scaffold (`bot/` service, python-telegram-bot) (#115)
- [x] Bot API client — typed httpx wrapper for backend endpoints (#116)
- [x] Inline keyboard filters — shared formatters, keyboards, filter callbacks (#118, #161)
- [x] `/new` — recently added/updated wines with filters (#118)
- [x] `/random` — random wine with filters (#118)
- [x] `/watch`, `/unwatch`, `/alerts` — passive watch list + on-demand status check (#119)
- [x] Post-scrape restock notifications — proactive alerts when watched products come back (#138)
- [x] Destock notifications — alert users when watched products go out of stock (#212)
- [x] Bot Dockerfile + Compose service (#121, #44)

### Phase 5a — Bot UX Polish ✅

- [x] Improve category selection UX (#162)
- [x] "Back" button to return to previous results (#163) — resolved by persistent reply keyboard
- [x] Main menu with navigation buttons (#164)
- [x] Disable link preview for multi-result messages (#165)
- [x] Paginated results with next/previous buttons (#167)
- [x] Auto-recap watch list after /watch and /unwatch (#183)

### Phase 5b — Store Availability

See [specs/STORE_AVAILABILITY.md](specs/STORE_AVAILABILITY.md) for API reference and engineering plan.

- [x] Store directory scrape (#128) — one-shot `stores` table (401 rows)
- [x] Emit destock events when availability flips True → False (#144)
- ~~Extract `magento_id` from HTML (#148)~~ — eliminated, GraphQL batch lookup used instead
- [x] `UserStorePreference` model + migration (#231)
- [x] `/stores` API endpoints — nearby + user preference CRUD (#232)
- [x] `/mystores` bot command — GPS-based store picker (#233)
- [x] Per-product store availability checker — GraphQL resolve + AJAX fetch + diff alerts (#149)
- ~~Filter by store availability (#150)~~ — out of scope, SAQ.com does this natively

### Phase 5c — Watch UX

- [ ] Auto-detect pasted SAQ URLs — prompt "Watch this?" without `/watch` command
- [ ] Inline unwatch buttons on `/alerts` list (#240)
- [ ] Deep links — `t.me/bot?start=watch_{sku}` for external watch triggers

### Phase 5d — Bilingual Support

- [ ] Per-user language preference (FR default, EN opt-in) (#134)
- [ ] Static translation tables for structured fields (#151)
- [ ] Bilingual bot responses, button labels, and help text (#152)
- [ ] Bilingual formatters (#153)

### Phase 5e — Discovery Rework (`/new` + `/random`)

Fix `/new` and `/random` so they solve real user problems instead of being demo placeholders.

**Phase 1 — Fix the basics:**

- [ ] Fix `/new` sort — use `created_at DESC` instead of `updated_at DESC` (current sort shows re-scrape order, not actual new arrivals)
- [ ] Richer product cards — show grape, region, country below the name/price line
- [ ] Default `/random` to wine categories only (not whisky, beer, sake, etc.)
- [ ] "🔄 Another" button on `/random` — re-roll without retyping the command

**Phase 2 — Make them useful:**

- [ ] Timeframe filter on `/new` — 7j / 30j / 90j buttons to scope "new since when"
- [ ] Inline "👁 Watch" button on product cards — one tap to watch from `/new` or `/random`
- [ ] Budget-aware defaults — remember last-used price filter per user

### Phase 6 — AI Layer (RAG + Claude)

- [ ] ChromaDB + embeddings (#154)
- [ ] Claude API integration (#155)
- [ ] `/recommend` — natural language recommendations via Telegram (#156)
- [ ] Weekly digest — LLM-curated summary posted to group chat after scraper run (#120)

### Ideas (unscoped)

- [ ] `/occasion` — context-aware suggestions ("wine for a BBQ", "gift for belle-mère") via Claude
- [ ] `/budget` — smart budget optimizer ("best rouge under $40") with value reasoning
- [ ] `/surprise` — discovery roulette that pushes outside comfort zone based on watch history
- [ ] `/gifter` — opt-in watch list sharing between friends for gift ideas
- [ ] `/blind` — blind tasting game: bot describes a wine, friends guess, track scores
- [ ] `/split` — group buy coordinator: share a bottle deal, track RSVPs among friends
- [ ] `/terroir` — region deep-dive with educational context + current SAQ inventory
- [ ] `/versus` — head-to-head wine comparison with Claude commentary on when to pick each
- [ ] `/cellar` — personal purchase tracker with taste profile insights over time
- [ ] `/digest` — weekly curated new arrivals summary, personalized to group preferences (#120)
- [ ] Rating aggregator — enrich products with Vivino scores and critic ratings; fuzzy name matching
- [ ] Price comparison vs France — compare SAQ prices to French retail (Wine-Searcher, Vinatis)
- [ ] Chrome extension — floating "Watch" button on SAQ product pages, triggers deep link to bot
